**Steps to Reproduce**

2. Log in with valid credentials.
3. Navigate to the top-right corner and click the "Logout" button.

**Expected vs Actual Behavior**

- **Expected**: User is logged out and redirected to the login page.
- **Actual**: Nothing happens when the "Logout" button is clicked. No visible feedback or redirection.

**Environment**

- Browser: Safari (latest version)
- OS: macOS Ventura / iOS 17
- Device: MacBook Pro / iPhone 14
- App Version: 2.1.4 (if known)

**Severity or Impact**  
Major â€” Logout functionality is a core security feature and its failure affects all Safari users, preventing proper session termination.
