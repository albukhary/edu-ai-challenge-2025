# Refactoring & Modernization Summary

## Overview

The legacy Sea Battle CLI game was refactored from a single ES5-style file into a modern, modular ES6+ codebase with improved structure, maintainability, and testability.

## Key Improvements

- **ES6+ Syntax:**

  - Replaced all `var` with `let`/`const`.
  - Used arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and classes.
  - Adopted ES modules (`import`/`export`).

- **Separation of Concerns:**

  - **Game.js:** Main game loop and orchestration.
  - **Board.js:** Board state, ship placement, hit/miss logic.
  - **Ship.js:** Ship state and sunk logic.
  - **CPU.js:** CPU opponent logic (hunt/target modes).
  - **UI.js:** CLI input/output abstraction.
  - **index.js:** Entry point.

- **No Global State:**

  - All state is encapsulated in classes and instances.

- **Testing:**

  - Added Jest unit tests for all core modules.
  - Achieved >60% coverage for statements, functions, and lines.

- **Documentation:**
  - Added this summary and a test coverage report.

## How to Run

- Run the game: `node index.js`
- Run tests: `npm test`

## Notes

- The refactor preserves all original game mechanics and CLI experience.
- The codebase is now ready for further extension, maintenance, or porting to other platforms.
