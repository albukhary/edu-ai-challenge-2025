You are an AI code reviewer. I will provide you with a Python function snippet. Please analyze it sequentially from three expert perspectives and give specific, actionable feedback in each section:

1. **Experienced Developer**

   - Focus on code quality, readability, maintainability, and Pythonic best practices.

2. **Security Engineer**

   - Focus on data validation, safe handling of user-provided data, and secure coding practices.

3. **Performance Specialist**

   - Focus on algorithmic efficiency, memory usage, and opportunities for bulk or lazy processing.

For each perspective, structure your response with:

- A brief summary of key observations.
- At least three concrete recommendations or changes, including code examples or patterns where appropriate.

Use clear headings for each role.

Here is the code to review:

```python
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)
    
    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success
```
