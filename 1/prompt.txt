You are an expert in database architecture and cloud systems. I need your help in choosing the most suitable database type for a new application based on specific technical requirements.

Please apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to evaluate the requirements step-by-step and make a justified recommendation.

Here are the requirements:

1. The application is a social platform expected to have millions of users.
2. It needs to store:
   - User profiles
   - Posts
   - Connections between users (i.e., friend or follow relationships)
3. High data read speed is required.
4. Read/write ratio is around 80% reads, 20% writes.
5. Scalability is very important due to expected user growth.

Your task is to:
- Analyze each requirement one-by-one
- Explain how each one impacts the choice of a database
- Compare at least two types of databases (e.g., relational, document-based, graph, key-value)
- Choose the most suitable database type (or combination if necessary)
- Justify your recommendation clearly

Please format your answer as a logical and readable step-by-step reasoning process (like solving a math word problem), and end with a final conclusion.
