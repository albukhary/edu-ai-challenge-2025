Let's go through the requirements step by step using Chain-of-Thought reasoning:

1. The application is a social platform expected to have millions of users.
→ This suggests a need for high scalability and support for a large volume of concurrent user data. Any chosen database must handle horizontal scaling efficiently.

2. It needs to store:
   - User profiles: Typically structured, fits well with relational or document databases.
   - Posts: Semi-structured data with varying formats and possible attachments (e.g., images), well-suited for document databases.
   - Connections between users: These are graph relationships (e.g., user A follows user B). Representing and querying these efficiently would benefit from a graph database.

3. High data read speed is required.
→ A system that can cache frequently accessed data or has efficient indexing is important. Document databases and graph databases can perform well in read-heavy environments depending on the query pattern.

4. Read/write ratio is around 80% reads, 20% writes.
→ A read-optimized system with good replication and caching mechanisms will be ideal. This also suggests that eventual consistency may be acceptable in certain areas.

5. Scalability is very important due to expected user growth.
→ Horizontal scalability is crucial. Document databases like MongoDB or cloud-native solutions like Amazon DynamoDB are built with scalability in mind. Relational databases can scale, but often require more effort (e.g., sharding).

Now, comparing database types:

- **Relational Databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL):
  - Strength: Strong consistency, great for structured data.
  - Weakness: Harder to scale horizontally and less suited for graph-like queries.

- **Document Databases** (e.g., MongoDB):
  - Strength: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, optimized for semi-structured data like posts.
  - Weakness: Not optimal for deeply connected data like user relationships.

- **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j):
  - Strength: Excellent for managing and querying user relationships.
  - Weakness: Not ideal for storing large volumes of unconnected data like posts.

✅ **Final Recommendation**:

Use a **polyglot persistence** approach:
- **MongoDB** for storing user profiles and posts, due to its flexible schema and excellent scalability for semi-structured data.
- **Neo4j** for storing and querying user connections, as it is optimized for graph relationships and can handle complex social graphs efficiently.

This hybrid setup aligns with the application's needs for scalability, high read performance, and varied data types.
