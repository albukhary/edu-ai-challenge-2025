A young person is experiencing sharp chest pain similar to a heart attack for the past three days. The pain comes and goes, worsens with coughing or lying down, and improves when leaning forward. There are no other symptoms besides the pain. The individual took Tylenol, has no existing medical conditions, and occasionally drinks alcohol. Family history includes a recent heart attack in the father. The healthcare provider suggests an ECG and blood work to determine the cause of the pain as it may not be related to a heart attack.
